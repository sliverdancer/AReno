# RIST negative-result handoff

Status: `NEURIPS_ED_RESEARCH_PACKAGE_CPU_ONLY_GPU_CLOSED`

This directory reframes the terminal RIST v3.1/v4.0 evidence as a negative
result about reward-resolution collapse under group-relative objectives. It is
not a v4 continuation plan and does not authorize any new GPU serving,
qualification, held-out/BFCL access, or training.

The key empirical fact is stable across two independent task-pool lineages:

- `RIST-C0-v3.1`: 2,048 calibration trajectories, zero common high-resolution cells.
- `RIST-C0-v4.0`: 2,048 calibration trajectories, zero common high-resolution cells.

The current target is a NeurIPS Evaluations & Datasets style evaluation
methodology paper. The package includes the formalism, related-work threat
matrix, diagnostic checklist, draft submission text, reproducible figures, and a
frozen external-audit protocol. Do not retune v4 after observing the calibration
outcomes.

The next admissible step is to execute the external audit protocol only after
separate authorization for data access and any required model/API/GPU inference.
